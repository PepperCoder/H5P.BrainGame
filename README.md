# H5P.BrainGame
A BrainGame for the H5P Framework

This content type was created for my BA in Computer Science dissertation (Hellenic Open University) in 2018.

If you want to use the content type, simply download BrainGame.h5p and load it on the H5P plugin of the CMS you use (tested on Moodle).

If you like it and you want to improve it, contribute or have a suggestion, leave a comment.
